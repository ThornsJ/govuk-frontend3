# Table
Consider putting content into tables to make it easier to scan.

## Numeric tabular data

when comparing rows of numbers, align numbers to the right in table cells
use the GOV.UK tabular numbers to allow numbers of the same width to be more easily compared

## Data in a table

Not all content in tables should be right aligned.

Use a caption to describe the table in the same way you would use a heading. It can help users find, navigate and understand tables.
