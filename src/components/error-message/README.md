#Error message in forms

For each error:
write a message that helps the user to understand why the error occurred and what to do about it
put the message in the <label> or <legend> for the question, after the question text, in red
use a red border to visually connect the message and the question it belongs to
if the error relates to specific text fields within the question, give these a red border as well
