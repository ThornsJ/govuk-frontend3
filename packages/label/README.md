# Label

* all form fields should be given labels
* donâ€™t hide labels, unless the surrounding context makes them unnecessary
* labels should be aligned above their fields
* label text should be short, direct and in sentence case
* avoid colons at the end of labels
* labels should be associated with form fields using the `for` attribute
